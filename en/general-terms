        <li>
            <p><u><i>Acceptance.</i></u>
                By registering on the prorealtime.com website ("<b>Site</b>"), you become a legitimate user
                ("<b>User</b>") of our online stock exchange information services ("<b>Services</b>"), certain of
                which are provided without charge and others on payment of a subscription, on the condition of accepting
                the present general terms of use and sale ("<b>Conditions of Use</b>") and if appropriate the special
                terms of use and sale ("<b>Special Conditions</b>") applicable to certain Services or coming from any
                other entity involved in the provision of the Services ("<b>Data Providers</b>"), such as for example
                the stock exchanges or telecommunicationscarriers.
            </p>
            <p>It is possible to link the Services to a financial instrument trading account held by a partner
                broker of PROREALTIME and to benefit, in this case, from a service of reception and transmission of
                orders from PROREALTIME ("<b>RTO Service</b>"). The supply of the RTO Service is governed by specific
                Special Conditions which are separate from the present Conditions of Use.
            </p>
            <p>For the purposes of the Conditions of Use and, if necessary, of the Special Conditions, the Services
                comprise, without this list being exhaustive, free or paid access to market data produced by Data
                Providers, to software tools, to assistance and training and more generally to any other service offered
                by PROREALTIME and available on the Site, with the exception of the RTO Service. The Services also
                include all of the communications made to Users, such as, in particular, administrative, technical or
                commercial messages, alerts, SMS alerts, RSS feeds, electronic messages (e-mails), messages by post,
                explanatory documents, videos, computer programs etc.<br/>
                The Conditions of Use and, if necessary, the Special Conditions, are established between PROREALTIME and
                yourself. If you do not accept the Conditions of Use, you cannot register nor have access to the
                Services. You are reminded that your consent to the Conditions of Use, and if necessary, to the Special
                Conditions, is given by a click on the space provided for that purpose on the registration and/or

                        displays. These people should consult their doctor before any use of the Services. If, while
