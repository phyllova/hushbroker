<p>The AUDUSD and NZDUSD led the rally against the US dollar yesterday and are doing the same again today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The surprising low inflation number from the US is what caused the rally yesterday. But today we have a new event that could be driving sentiment in these pairs. This event is still underway, so it still to play out completely, and its consequences still to be digested and figured into the market: This event is the meeting of Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The meetings represent a cooling of trade (and otherwise) tensions between the two countries.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Expected drop from 6.7% to 4.8% this week may create room for disappointment and increase pressure on the GBPJPY, already at a multi-month high.</li>



<li>Recent market activity, including rejection of a downside wick and an immediate move to the upside, supports a bullish GBPJPY outlook. Further upward movement could challenge the three-month high, potentially prompting correction or intervention.</li>

<p>The UK’s inflation rate due this week (early early Wednesday morning), and there is a huge projected drop in the reading from last month, from 6.7% to 4.8%. This huge drop leaves a lot of room for disappointment, and higher CPI reading could exert upside pressure on the <a href="https://forexrover.com/en/trading/instruments/forex/forex-minors/gbpjpyi-great-britain-pound-vs-japanese-yen/">GBPJPY</a>, which is already at a multi-month high. It is for this reason I bring up the possibility that traders should watch for intervention in this pair, whether direct or indirect. </p>

<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Supporting the possibility of a bullish <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/GBPJPY/">GBP/JPY</a> is the rejection of yesterday&#8217;s significant downside wick (touching the 50-day moving average on the 1-hour chart). This rejection was followed by a further move to the upside.  </p>



<p>Further upside will see the pair challenge the three-month high at 186.77 and open the possibility for a correction/ intervention. In the past, ¥185.00 has proven to be somewhat of an anchor point for the pair, but perhaps a more accurate support is now ¥185.50?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t forget that US CPI numbers are due this week too, one day before UK numbers hit the market.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is expected to announce an interest rate decision with a 70% chance of a 25-basis point rate hike, driven by concerns about inflation.</li>



<li>Weaker U.S. Non-Farm Payroll figures have raised doubts about the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s tightening policy, influencing the AUD/USD exchange rate.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="502" src="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mel.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80051" srcset="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mel.png 1024w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mel-300x147.png 300w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mel-768x377.png 768w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mel-360x176.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>We are about 8 hours away from the latest Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That decision is due on Tuesday at 2:30 pm (local Aussie time), a couple of hours before the country&#8217;s biggest horse race, the Melbourne Cup ($8 million in prize money) is set to take place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But perhaps the more exciting match ups will be occurring in the forex market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, the market is thinking there is a 70% chance of a 25-basis points hike because of the RBA governor&#8217;s rhetoric that the bank would &#8220;not hesitate to raise the cash rate further&#8221; if inflation was higher than expected (which it was in its last quarterly reading). The 30% chance of no hike is possibly driven by concerns about mortgage stress in the country after the post-COVID 12 cash rate increases.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>On the flip side of some potential AUD trades, we have expectations for the US Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) enacting a 25-basis points cut by June next year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weaker-than-expected NFP figures in the U.S. last Friday bolstered expectations that the Fed was done with its tightening campaign and pulled the AUD/USD up past 0.64900 from 0.64400. This makes me question whether the upside to the AUD/USD is all played out. Moments after the interest rate announcement will be crucial to see which direction the market wants to take.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the RBA does enact a hike today, concerns about mortgage stress in Australia might induce the pair to revisit some of the levels the pair traversed last Friday during its climb just before market close.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Market skepticism about the &#8220;hawkish pause&#8221; and doubts about the US Fed&#8217;s ability to make tough decisions, especially concerning rate hikes.</li>



<li>Jerome Powell&#8217;s remarks on potential rate hikes and the market&#8217;s initial response, including the rise of the Australian dollar and the USD&#8217;s decline against the yen.</li>

<p>Has the market adopted the term “hawkish pause” to bolster USD bids? It could be possible that, in an attempt to drag out USD strength just a little bit longer (<a href="https://forexrover.com/en/trading/instruments/forex/forex-majors-forex/eurusd-euro-vs-us-dollar/">euro </a>has weakened –4.20% in past 6 months), the term Hawkish Pause has been thrown around with not-enough criticism. </p>



<p>Not many people have confidence in the US Fed to really make the hard decisions (transitory inflation anyone?), including being able to start up the rate hiking engine again (this year or next) after a few pauses. If they do, will they do it in a timely manner? &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jerome Powell, this morning noted in his public address that the committee hasn’t discussed what it might plan for its December decision but dismissed the idea that it would be difficult to start hiking again (if the conditions in the market require such an action). There are two more inflation readings and two more labor market readings before the last decision of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe investors have shrugged off the hawkish pause rhetoric this morning though. The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AUDUSD/">Australian dollar</a> is pumping, up 0.94% at last look, while the dollar has fallen more than half a percent against the yen. The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EURUSD/">EURUSD </a>is only up 0.16%. </p>

<p>Investor flight to safety might&nbsp;provide a favorable outlook for the Swiss franc this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swiss franc against the <a href="https://forexrover.com/en/trading/instruments/forex/forex-majors-forex/usdchf-us-dollar-vs-swiss-franc/">USD</a> and <a href="https://forexrover.com/en/trading/instruments/forex/forex-minors/gbpchf-great-britain-pound-vs-swiss-franc/">GBP</a> might be the most interesting considering the Fed and the Bank of England (BoE) hold their policy meetings this week, where they are both expected to keep rates exactly where they are. These pauses by the Fed and BoE might contrast too sharply with the Swiss National Bank (SNB), whose Vice-Chairman made some hawkish comments over the weekend, pushing back against expectations that the SNB is done with its rate hikes, and cause some rumblings in the USDCHF and GBPCHF. </p>

<p>Investor risk-aversion has already caused the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CHFEUR/">Swiss franc</a> to hit a high not seen since 2015 against the Euro. Euro Area inflation is also due this week, so this pair might also be appropriate to watch this week. </p>



<p>Regarding&nbsp;the&nbsp;Middle East conflict, latest developments have seen Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deny they would agree to ceasefire, drawing parallels to US retaliation to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. In this way, we might expect drawn out conflict, and the desirability of the Swiss franc rising. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The CPI figures show a quarterly inflation increase of 1.2% and an annual increase of 5.4%, raising pressure on the RBA to consider another interest rate hike. But, is the conviction to hike any more really there?&nbsp;</p>



<p>RBA&#8217;s newly appointed governor, Michele Bullock, delivered a strong message during her public address yesterday, warning that the bank won’t hesitate to raise interest rates if inflation doesn’t behave itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commonwealth Bank of Australia and ANZ have both now revised their rate pause view. Both now see a 0.25% hike in November. Similarly, traders are predicting a 65% chance of a rate hike next month too. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The RBA would be one of the very few central banks still hiking, which might add some fuel to <a href="https://forexrover.com/en/trading/instruments/forex/forex-majors-forex/audusd-australian-dollar-vs-us-dollar/">AUD</a> bulls (Markets think that both the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are done with hiking).  </p>



<p>On the back of higher-than-expected inflation data, the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AUDUSD/">AUD/USD</a> appreciated toward a strong resistance at 0.63995, hitting its strongest levels in almost two weeks. However, sellers came into the market here, and have since pushed the pair below where it started yesterday, keeping its long-term downward trajectory intact. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Will bearish bets on the Canadian dollar grow in the lead up to Wednesday?

<ul>
<li>Bearish sentiment surrounds the Canadian dollar due to expectations of the central bank holding interest rates, though a hawkish hold is possible.</li>



<li>The USD/CAD faces resistance levels at 1.36936 and 1.37189, with indications that overcoming these levels may not be too challenging.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="502" src="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/usdcad.png" alt="" class="wp-image-78914" srcset="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/usdcad.png 1024w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/usdcad-300x147.png 300w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/usdcad-768x377.png 768w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/usdcad-360x176.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Will bearish bets on the <a href="https://forexrover.com/en/trading/instruments/forex/forex-majors-forex/usdcad-us-dollar-vs-canadian-dollar/">Canadian dollar</a> grow in the lead up to Wednesday? It is widely expected that the Canadian central bank will leave interest rates on hold during its meeting that concludes on this day (Although, it may be a hawkish hold as the Governor Tiff Macklem will mention that another hike is still on the table for the bank).  </p>



<p>Perhaps piling on the bearish sentiment is the slight fall in the price of&nbsp;oil (one of Canada&#8217;s major exports), as US diplomatic efforts continue to contain the conflict between Israel and Hamas. How long this quietish period can last is up for debate though, and a ground offensive by the IDF in Gaza could send oil prices higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bullish takes on the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/usdcad/">USD/CAD</a> (i.e., bearish bets on the Loonie) will have 1.37350 to content with, which is the high the pair reached before cratering to 1.36712 to start the week. 1.36936 is the more immediate resistance for bull to cross before even thinking about the day&#8217;s high. The RSI’s weakness suggests this won’t be too difficult though, and 1.37189 might be the more formidable resistance. </p>

<ul>
<li>Gold prices have risen significantly due to escalating geopolitical tensions, with a notable increase since the Gaza City hospital blast.</li>



<li>Analyzing the gold market&#8217;s trajectory has become more challenging, and it&#8217;s essential to consider broader geopolitical context and potential upside targets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where does <a href="https://forexrover.com/en/trading/instruments/metals-commodities/">gold</a> go if the Gaza war escalates and are downside targets for gold pointless to think about right now? Perhaps it is prudent to think about some short-term retracements, but it does appear that the war will escalate or at least tensions remain heightened for quite some time, which is bullish for gold.  </p>



<p>The latest event that could escalate the Gaza war is the blast at&nbsp;the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City&nbsp;that is said to have killed 500 people. Initially attributed to Israel, it is now looking more likely that&nbsp;it was caused by a rocket misfired from within Gaza. This was echo by U.S. President&nbsp;Joe Biden&nbsp;during his visit to Tel Aviv on Wednesday where he also pledged U.S. solidarity with Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gold has already risen by more than $120 since the October 7<sup>th</sup> attack, and around $80 since last Friday. RSI is above the midpoint for most timeframes, but this indicator’s accuracy might be compromised considering the wider geopolitical context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>$1,960 is the obvious upside target for <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/">XAU/USD</a> to clear, and then we might want to simply look at physiological levels rather than technical levels considering the unprecedented nature of the events that might be driving the gold price right now. </p>

<li>Even after correction, Bitcoin maintained a 5% gain, hinting at market anticipation for the SEC&#8217;s ETF decision.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fake news sent <a href="https://forexrover.com/en/trading/instruments/crypto/btcusd-bitcoin-vs-usd/">Bitcoin</a> up about 10% on Monday, surging from $27,900 to over $30,000&nbsp;after Crypto news site Cointelegraph posted on X that the Securities and Exchange Commission had approved BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to the rumor, BlackRock had to clarify that no decision had been made regarding their ETF application. Even though the rumor has now been debunked, Bitcoin is still up more than 5%, at $28,600, with some movement suggesting that buyers are still willing to probe for more gains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 10% upside move has perhaps provided us with a preview of what might happen when/ if the SEC eventually approves or rejects BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF application. It could also be argued that we are also getting a glimpse into what could happen to <a href="https://forexrover.com/en/trading/instruments/crypto/btcusd-bitcoin-vs-usd/">BTC/USD</a> if the SEC rejects the application, with targets set at the pre-rumor price of $27,900 the first port of call on the chart. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Fancy selling into uncertainty?

<ul>
<li>United States&#8217;s election, too close to call, stirs uncertainty in NZD/USD trading.</li>



<li>Controversies around the National Party and the Reserve Bank&#8217;s role add to the election-induced downside risks.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="502" src="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NZDUSD-Targets-for-Election-Night.png" alt="" class="wp-image-76319" srcset="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NZDUSD-Targets-for-Election-Night.png 1024w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NZDUSD-Targets-for-Election-Night-300x147.png 300w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NZDUSD-Targets-for-Election-Night-768x377.png 768w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NZDUSD-Targets-for-Election-Night-360x176.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Fancy selling into uncertainty? This could be a scenario for the <a href="https://forexrover.com/en/trading/instruments/forex/forex-majors-forex/nzdusd-new-zealand-dollar-vs-us-dollar/">NZD/USD</a> in the lead up to the election in United States which is way too close to call for either major political party right now (Labour vs National). Voting has been open all week and closes October 14, with the winner called the same day (but after the close of this trading week). </p>



<p>Polls have the right leaning National party carving out a small lead at the moment, but some hiccups have seen this lead shrink in the past week (e.g., The were caught knowingly lying about amount the average person would receive from their promised tax cuts)&nbsp;</p>

<!-- TradingView Chart END -->



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>National has also promised to remove the Reserve Bank of United States&#8217;s mandate to consider employment in its interest rate decisions, which could shift the central bank to a more dovish bias (as current strong employment figures in NZ are perhaps heightening its proclivity to hike). Combine this with the general uncertainty induced by the election, and some downside targets for the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NZDUSD/">United States Dollar</a> could be charted in anticipation for election night and the Monday following the results. </p>



<p>The recent touch point for the 0.5861 is the most obvious target that the pair will have to overcome if it wants to seek lower targets. This would also open up new 2023 lows, with 2022 benchmarks helping set possible targets. &nbsp;</p>
