<p>In order to take full advantage of the automated trading opportunities from Autochartist, it is important to first learn about some important areas of this web-based platform&#8217;s user interface.<br><br></p>
<p>The results column provides an emerging pattern alert such as the sample below:</p>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="624" height="15" src="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Autochartist-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9686" srcset="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Autochartist-1.jpg 624w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Autochartist-1-300x7.jpg 300w, https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Autochartist-1-360x9.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /><br><br></figure>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Emerging patterns enable a proactive trading approach as trends are notified before the price behavior penetrates either the support line or the resistance line of the pattern. There are also some key <em>Quality Indicators</em> that will further confirm or filter the results based on the pattern type, trend, and price action. This way, much of the subjectivity in chart pattern trading is eliminated, making it possible to trade unbiasedly.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Traders should first note that this NZD/CHF alert shown above for a Falling Wedge is on a 15-minute intraday time frame shown on both the alert line and the chart itself. <strong>Autochartist scans periods of 15, 30, 60, 240, and 1,440 minutes.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The <strong>15-minute chart represents the shortest timeframe</strong> that Autochartist displays sample results. The pattern type, as well as the likely direction of the pattern break, are all listed on the chart. <strong>A Falling Wedge is a popular pattern.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This Falling Wedge is the pattern that appears on the NZD/CHF short-term intraday chart. The Initial Trend reading helps confirm the present trend&#8217;s strength. An initial trend value of 6-bars or higher is the best way to confirm the continuation of the trend pattern, while the maximum reading is 10-bars. As seen from the example, the reading is 3 bars, suggesting lateral volatility. However, another bar shows the transition to the trend. One more bar, though, would indicate the start of a trend.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Within your pattern filtering process, the Initial Trend reading will be one of the most essential Quality Indicators.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>To summarize, emerging patterns represent proactive trading possibilities, while completed patterns represent reactive and trade management opportunities.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Filtering is critical for getting the most out of the trade opportunities that come in during the day. Each trader must be aware of the factors associated with conservative from aggressive entries.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-68480"></figure>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p><p>In a 60-minute time frame, the pattern trading opportunity for NZD/USD was completed.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Take note of the following distinctions between emerging and completed patterns:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. Whether or not the price movement had momentum when it broke the pattern (see Breakout); and</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2. The Forecast Area, which will be plotted on completed chart patterns automatically.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Emerging patterns will occasionally reveal a break in the trend. This is because Autochartist updates the price on a 15-minute chart every 15 minutes.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Breakout reading reveals the pattern&#8217;s momentum in breaking through the Triangle pattern&#8217;s resistance line. As can be observed, the Breakout reading is very low, at a minimum of 1-bar. This shows that when prices soar, the momentum is weak, and as a result, expectations for immediate continuation are low. Note that if the pattern breaks down before an economic event or before the opening of a financial center like Sydney or New York, it could have significant follow-through afterwards.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The last pattern shows Forecast Area (outlined), showing resistance because it is placed above the price breakdown.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Forecast Area provides traders with trade management advice, making completed patterns valuable once an entry has been made.</p>

							<p>If you are having issues connecting your MetaTrader platform with Autochartist, consult the following list of common issues and resolutions that may remedy your situation.</p><p><br></p>
<p>Common issues:<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Did the <strong>Installation</strong> work? Is the EA listed under MetaTrader&#8217;s Expert Advisors?<br><br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If not, try getting the <u>installation log </u>and forwarding it onto the Autochartist support team.<br><br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Are there any <strong>Error Messages</strong>? Take a screenshot of the error message and if you do not understand the error message, send it to <a href="mailto:brokersupport@autochartist.com">Broker Support</a>.<br><br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Confirm that <strong>Webrequests</strong> are enabled and configured in MetaTrader correctly.<br><br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is it requesting <strong>Authentication</strong>? The Terminal Server, Account Server, and Live or Demo Trading account are all checked for authentication. Verify that you are using a Live Trading account on your branded MetaTrader terminal.<br><br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is there a notification that says <strong>&#8220;Delayed Results&#8221;</strong> or are features missing? For instance, if you are using a demo account, the EA may display &#8220;Delayed Results&#8221; and the Probability filter section may be missing. If you have a VIP level requirement, you may not reach the required balance, preventing you from using the Probability Filter even when they have access to live results.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Check Powershell version. </strong>On Windows computers, the most typical error during installation is that you are using an older version of Windows or that your Powershell is out of date.<br><br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can resolve this by either running Windows updates (depending on the version of Windows) or by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6">manually updating their Powershell version</a>.</li>

							<p>Instances in which a financial instrument has seen unusually substantial movement (either up or down) is called a “Big Movement.” Both trend followers and swing traders will benefit from this style of analysis.</p>
<p>It could be an indication of a new trend formation for trend watchers. For swing traders, it could be a hint that a correction is on the way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-68511" width="350" height="489"></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><br></figure>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Autochartist takes note of each instrument&#8217;s typical number of consecutive candles, and the trader is notified when an unusual movement happens.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Statistical Details</b></p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Autochartist builds a histogram of consecutive candles by looking back up to 600 candles for every instrument, every direction, for Hourly, 4 Hourly and Daily candles. This means that for each instrument, we keep track of five different distributions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Below is the probability distribution for the example shown above, USD/JPY 4 hourly candles:</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the above histogram, note that during the last 600 candles, we only get 1 “consecutive” bullish candle roughly 50% of the time, indicating that the USD/JPY H4 graph alternates between bullish and bearish candles 50% of the time. We can also observe that we get two consecutive bullish candles about 30% of the time, and three consecutive bullish candles about 10% of the time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>If we add these numbers up until we reach a 95% threshold, everything above that is considered &#8220;out of the norm&#8221; by more than 2 standard deviations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>That means that if the USD/JPY H4 chart shows 4 or more consecutive bullish candles, Autochartist will generate a &#8220;result.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Each symbol, data interval, and direction can produce a unique probability distribution. Furthermore, because we generate new distributions every day using a changing window of past data, the results may alter over time.</p>

<p><strong>When planning for his day trading activities, a trader often has little or no idea about the trading style that he would employ during the day. He often decides to start with no bias toward the short or the long sides.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite his belief in a systematic approach, he is most likely not using a trading strategy and many of his trading decisions are based on his interpretation of chart patterns, as well as what he considers to be the optimal entry and exit strategy. Support and resistance levels may be used to trigger this process. The trader may not even take time into consideration other than the time period of the chart that he chooses to follow.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The trader takes an almost fearless attitude to day-trading the market, believing that by following the market&#8217;s lead and interpreting the order flow, he will be successful. He may have some success early in the session, but then he starts to have some difficulties. He will then be compelled to become more analytical in his approach after suffering a string of losses.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The trouble is that he doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s looking for and his dependence on “going with the flow” of the trade has prevented him from recognizing market patterns. The predicted movement per day or intraday, as well as the time of day are just some of the factors that he may have missed.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Autochartist offers an analytical tool for traders that shows insights into the relative movements of the Forex, Futures, Index CFD, and Shares markets aside from the chart patterns and quality indicators that the platform generates.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This data can be a useful tool for traders when evaluating the reward/risk of a particular chart pattern because it provides information on possible price forecasts, risk factors, and time-related patterns.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Autochartist Volatility Analysis tool is an analytical instrument that provides information to Forex traders such as the average pip movement over specific time frames, the potential up or down momentum based on history, the maximum expected price movements (statistical highs and lows) across different time frames, and the expected price movements over weekday and hourly time frames.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For a trader, the average movement over specific time periods is a vital information as it eliminates the guesswork in determining where a market will go and whether or not upside and downside targets are reasonable. A trader can use empirical data to create stop loss or profit targets instead of attempting to calculate profit targets and stop losses manually while deciding which trade position to enter. This removes the randomness of such a choice.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-68559"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><br></figure>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The financial markets have a tendency to be more aggressive at various times of the day, unless it is a news or event-driven day. The openings and closings of various financial instruments tend to be the most active time periods. The key determinants of price action, volatility and volume, usually exert the most impact over those two time periods.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Because the financial markets are open 24 hours a day, these opens and closures happen at different times throughout the day, allowing the trader plenty of opportunities to profit from the extreme volatility. However, there are also certain periods during the day when the markets just trade flat. When there is no one there to trade it, even the best chart pattern setup can fail.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Autochartist’s Volatility Analysis feature, which is based on a six-month average of hourly price ranges, provides traders with information on the time periods when specific markets are more active. This makes locating trade alerts and understanding why markets consolidate easier. Users will be able to use this data to determine which markets are beginning to consolidate and which markets are about to emerge from consolidation. This knowledge could give you a leg up when it comes to identifying chart patterns that indicate a breakout move is on the way.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture9.png" alt="" class="wp-image-68567"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><br></figure>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>With the Volatility Analysis tool, traders can get a better idea of what the market is capable of on any particular day, making it useful — when combined with an economic calendar — to users in taking note of major economic events that are coming up.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The tool calculates the high-to-low range during a 24-hour period, with the average movement for that day marked within a range.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, whether or not you use the Volatility Analysis tools in your trading strategy is a personal choice, but if you answer yes to any of the following questions, you should probably use the data as a guideline:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol type="1"><p></p>
<li>Do you find yourself unable to hold on to trades until your strategy stops you out?</li>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<li>Do you ever get stopped out just as your deal is about to go in your favor?</li>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<li>Do you frequently trade in the hopes that the market would swiftly swing in your favor?</li></ol><div><br></div><ol type="1">
<p></p></ol>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you responded yes to any of these questions, then Volatility Analysis is something you should try to work with.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The big advantage is that the platform identifies and calculates the patterns. It may take hours to determine whether a trend taking place fits into the generally accepted Fibonacci pattern. Even after completing this task, analysts still need to determine if there are trading opportunities.</p><p><br></p>
<p>With Autochartist, these possibilities are taken care of as it attempts to spot emerging patterns so that the trader can plan ahead for possible trading opportunities. The platform’s completed patterns also help traders view an active pattern or one that may be acted upon if the trader so chooses.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-68523"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><br></figure>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The analysis of Fibonacci patterns requires a lot of patience and mathematics. But with Autochartist, the platform is able to analyze hundreds of patterns and apply the mathematics needed in determining trading alerts. This way, the trader will be given more time to evaluate trading opportunities, as well as to optimally plot his entry, trailing stop, and exit strategies. Eliminating the need for patience also helps traders cope with the emotional strain that the market and trading can cause.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://forexrover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-68532"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><br></figure>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Employing Fibonacci patterns for analysis also provides the trader with a neutral perspective on the market. This removes any potential for prejudice, such as from current events or economic reports. Fibonacci patterns are, to put it simply, mathematical patterns that look at the market and say “this is what it has done” and “this is what it can do based on its past history.” It&#8217;s a rather easy mathematical market study with no external influences.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another benefit of using Fibonacci patterns is how it helps a trader to track whether the market returns to a certain price range or whether it will extend. The trader will then be able to decide whether to wait for a better entry price than the current market price or whether to pay more for the chance to capture higher returns.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>With the creation of price level targets through Fibonacci patterns, traders can better set reasonable price targets, letting them decide whether or not to execute a trade because the risk/reward ratio can be simply computed.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As with any trading tool, traders are strongly encouraged to explore and experiment with these Fibonacci patterns before taking risks. This helps traders determine some of the peculiarities of this type of analysis. It is critical for the trader to establish that this form of analysis is appropriate for his trading style. Some traders are convinced that a specific trading discipline is right for them after a few early successes, blinded by the profits before realizing the risks involved.</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It&#8217;s critical to try to figure out which Fibonacci patterns function best under certain conditions to get the most benefit from these mathematical patterns. By understanding this part of the analysis tool, traders can better understand how to make good use of the Fibonacci pattern.</p>
